            <h2>Prado Overview</h2>

            <p>The Toyota Land Cruiser Prado is a full-size four-wheel drive vehicle in the Land Cruiser range. It is produced by the Japanese car maker, Toyota. The Prado is one of the smaller vehicles in the range. From 2009, the Prado is based on Toyota's J150 platform. In some countries it is available as the equivalent Lexus GX.</p>
            
            <p>The Prado may also be referred to as Land Cruiser LC70, LC90, LC120 and LC150 depending on the platform. In some markets, it is known simply as the Toyota Prado.</p>
        
            <p>In North America, the Prado is not part of the Land Cruiser range; the rebadged Lexus GX occupies the Prado's position in luxury trim. The GX uses practically identical body panels and V8 engine.</p>
            
            <p>The Prado has ladder frame chassis, two-speed transfer boxes and rear beam axles. The J70 platform has a front beam axle, while the J90, J120 and J150 platforms have front independent suspension. As of 2014, the Prado is available in every Toyota market, except the US, Canada (both available as the Lexus GX), Mexico, Brazil and South Korea.</p>
        
            <p>In April 1990, a new type, the Prado, was introduced, with a redesigned front grille, front fenders, engine hood, and head lamps. At the same time, names like Land Cruiser and Land Cruiser II were still used in other parts of the world besides Japan. Despite a body-on-frame design making it highly capable off-road, the vehicle was marketed toward on-road use.</p>

In 2017, Toyota's corporate structure consisted of 364,445 employees worldwide [4] and, as of December 2019, was the tenth-largest company in the world by revenue. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world followed by Volkswagen Group, based on 2020 unit sales.[5][6] Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, which it has done since 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle.[7] As of July 2014, Toyota was the largest listed company in Japan by market capitalization (worth more than twice as much as number 2-ranked SoftBank)[8] and by revenue.[9][10]</p>
